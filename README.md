# Insurance-Risk-&-Claim-Analysis-Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
The **Insurance Risk & Claim Analysis Dashboard** is a comprehensive data analytics and visualization project developed in **Microsoft Power BI**.  
It is designed to analyze insurance claim patterns, policyholder demographics, and risk exposure, offering a detailed understanding of factors influencing claim frequency and total claim amounts.  

This dashboard serves as a strategic decision-support tool for insurance professionals, enabling them to monitor claim behavior, assess high-risk segments, and improve policy pricing and risk management ‚Äî all through a clean, interactive, and data-driven interface.

## Key Objectives  

- **Claim Trend Analysis ‚Üí** Track total claims, claim frequency, and claim amount distribution across demographic and vehicle-based segments.  
- **Risk Profiling ‚Üí** Identify high-risk policyholders and regions contributing most to overall claims for proactive loss control.  
- **Customer Segmentation ‚Üí** Analyze behavior by gender, education, marital status, and car use to understand claim patterns across customer groups.  
- **Operational Optimization ‚Üí** Use insights such as claim-to-policy ratio and average claim amount to refine underwriting and improve profitability.  
- **Strategic Decision-Making ‚Üí** Provide management with data-backed insights to enhance policy structure, pricing strategy, and risk evaluation models.

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Microsoft Power BI ‚Üí** Core tool used for building interactive dashboards and visual reports.  
- **Excel (`insurance_policies_data.xlsx`) ‚Üí** Used as the primary data source, containing structured records of policies and claims.  
- **Power Query ‚Üí** For data transformation, cleaning, and preparing datasets for visualization.  
- **Data Modeling & DAX ‚Üí** To calculate KPIs such as average claim frequency, total claim amount, and demographic breakdowns.
